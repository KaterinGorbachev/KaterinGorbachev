## Hi there 👋

<!--
👋 Hi there! I'm Katerina Gorbacheva.
👀 My interests span across website design, data science, software testing, legislation around the Internet, and the history of art.
🌱 Currently, I'm delving deep into web accessibility and better user experience.
📫 You can reach out to me here.
⚡ Fun fact: I’d rather spend my free evening at a hackathon or IT meetup than hanging out.
